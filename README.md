# Space-Recreation-Game

We developed a Space Recreation Game. It's a two player game. In this game one player throw a volleyball type ball to the other player. The other player hit the ball by his head. We placed a piezoelectric sensor on the astronaut’s safety helmet . The sensor is used to measure the hitting position and pressure when one player hit the ball by his head. On the basis of the measured value of the hitting position and pressure the Sensor Controller generate a score. The score value transmitted by using a RF transmitter to the RF receiver & Signal processing Unit.  Signal processing Unit Process the score value. Finally by using a Scoreboard the scores of the each player's shown. Each over completed by playing six balls and round completed by predefined no of overs.  If at the first round the player 1 throw the balls then the 2nd round the player 2 throw the balls.At the next part of the Signal processing Unit we are using serial communication to display the score by using desktop monitor. To do that we are using Processing programming language.
The game is fully suitable in the microgravity condition, Less space is required in the microgravity environment, the game is very enjoyable. Actually the game is the enjoyable version of physical exercise.
